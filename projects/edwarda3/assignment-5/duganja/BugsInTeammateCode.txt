1. Found from TimeTableTest.java
The TimeTable.deleteAppt() method returning null on a valid appt when it should return that appt.
This bug’s source was actually somewhat difficult to spot, because it’s not randomly fulfilling one of the if statements to return null. 
Instead, the bounds of the iteration are incorrect, meaning if the last appt is being deleted or there is only one appt it will fail.

2. Found from Appt.java
The appt was returning that this particular appt that should be invalid is valid.
The appt’s “flag” that it was invalid was the hour was set to 24, when acceptable ranges should only be 0-23. 
This edge case exposed a bug that 24 was being set as valid.
